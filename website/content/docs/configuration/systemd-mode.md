In systemd mode, OpenPERouter is configured via static files on the host instead of Kubernetes Custom Resources. See the [Systemd Mode installation guide]({{< ref "../installation/systemd-mode.md" >}}) for deployment instructions.

## Node Configuration

Each node requires a mandatory configuration file at `/var/lib/openperouter/node-config.yaml`. This file identifies the node and configures its unique index used for IPAM address allocation from the configured CIDRs.

The node index can be provided in two ways:

#### Static Node Index

Set `nodeIndex.index` to a unique integer per node:

```yaml
nodeIndex:
  index: 0
logLevel: debug
```

#### Deriving Node Index from an Interface

Instead of assigning a static index to each node, set `nodeIndex.interfaceName` to the name of a network interface on the host. The node index is derived from the host portion of the first IPv4 address on that interface. For example, if the interface `eth0` has address `192.168.11.3/24`, the node index is `3`.

This allows deploying the same `node-config.yaml` to every node, since each node's index is determined automatically from its own network address.

`nodeIndex.index` and `nodeIndex.interfaceName` are mutually exclusive.

```yaml
nodeIndex:
  interfaceName: eth0
logLevel: debug

Each `openpe_*.yaml` file contains the `spec` part of the corresponding Kubernetes Custom Resources. A file can contain any combination of `underlay`, `l3vnis`, `l2vnis`, `bgppassthrough`, and `rawfrrconfigs` fields, where each entry follows the same schema as the `spec` section of the equivalent CR (Underlay, L3VNI, L2VNI, L3Passthrough, RawFRRConfig):

```yaml
underlays:
  - asn: 64514
    tunnelEndpoint:
      cidrs:
      - 100.65.0.0/24
    nics:
      - eth0
    neighbors:
      - asn: 64512
        address: 192.168.111.1
l3vnis:
  - vrf: red
    vni: 100
    hostSession:
      asn: 64514
      hostASN: 64515
      localCIDR:
        ipv4: "192.169.10.0/24"
        ipv6: "2001:db8:1::/64"
l2vnis:
  - vrf: storage
    vni: 300
    vxlanport: 4789
    hostmaster:
      type: linux-bridge
      linuxBridge:
        name: br-storage
```

### Splitting Configuration Across Files

Multiple files can coexist in the configs directory. This is useful when nodes share a common base configuration but require different underlays. For example, a shared VNI definition can live in one file while per-node underlay settings go in another:

```yaml
# openpe_vni.yaml - common across nodes
l3vnis:
  - vrf: red
    vni: 100
```

```yaml
# openpe_underlay.yaml - node-specific
underlays:
  - asn: 64514
    tunnelEndpoint:
      cidrs:
      - 100.65.0.0/24
    nics:
      - eth0
    neighbors:
      - asn: 64512
        address: 192.168.111.1
```

### Deferring Startup

If the controller should wait for external dependencies before starting, place an executable script at `/var/lib/openperouter/can_start.sh`. When present, it runs as an `ExecStartPre` step and the controller will not start until the script exits successfully.

Depending on the CNI, the network configuration might need to be complete before the controller starts. For example, DNS resolution might need to be working, or specific network interfaces might need to be available. The script can poll for these conditions and exit with success (code 0) when ready, or exit with failure (non-zero) to prevent startup.

### Dynamic Reload

Configuration files are watched for changes and dynamically reloaded at runtime. Updating a file triggers a reconciliation cycle without restarting the service.

### Merging with API Server Configuration

When a kubeconfig is available (exported by the hostbridge pod), configuration from the Kubernetes API server is merged with the file-based configuration. This allows managing part of the configuration via Kubernetes CRs while keeping the base overlay setup in static files that are applied at boot time.
